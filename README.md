# OrbiterSensor_PC4-M10

I created this file, because the original Orbiter Sensor light guide does not hold the PTFE in place sufficiently to my taste.

PC4-M10 connector for Orbiter Sensor.
- Print upside down, no suports needed. I used transparent ABS, but light colored ABS will also work.
- Use M10x1.25 tap to clean up threads
- Plug in and enjoy!
